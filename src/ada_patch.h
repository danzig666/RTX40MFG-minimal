// Ada (SM 8.9) temporal correction for NVIDIA's DLSS-G provider.
//
// The stock Ada frame-generation kernel scales motion by a hardcoded 0.5,
// which is correct for 2x (one generated frame at the midpoint) but collapses
// every generated frame onto the same temporal position at 3x and above. This
// rebuilds the provider's SM89 PTX so those 104 midpoint multiplies read the
// kernel's own temporal parameter t (and 1 - t) instead, then republishes the
// rebuilt fatbin through a cloned kernel descriptor.
//
// Every step is fail-closed: the adapter must be Ada, the provider version
// must be known, and the source fatbin, source PTX and rebuilt fatbin must all
// match their expected SHA-256 digests before anything is published.
